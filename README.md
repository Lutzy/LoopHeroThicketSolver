# LoopHeroThicketSolver

This is just a simple brute force solver to the optimal thicket/river solution for a 12x5 area in the game Loop Hero. Feel free to make it better and open a PR!

The run is currently still ongoing, but the current best found solution is: https://loopherolayout.xyz?c=111221211211211211211211211211211212212121121112111211211122 which yields 234

For a 12x4 area, the best possible score is 176, of which there are multiple options, but here's one which uses only 14 thickets: https://loopherolayout.xyz?c=211101121012110211201121012110121201111021210112101211011120
